# ArduinoBurglarAlarm
Project Title: Arduino Burglar Alarm with Power Backup and Cellular Notification

Description:

This Arduino-based Burglar Alarm project is designed to provide robust security features and reliable functionality. The key features of this code implementation are:

    Motion Detection: The alarm system utilizes a Passive Infrared (PIR) motion detector, coupled with a 433MHz RF module, to detect intruders and trigger the alarm.

    Dual Power Supply: The system is powered by a 12V power supply and a 7.4V Li-ION battery configuration (two cells in series). This dual power setup ensures continuous operation even if the main power supply is disrupted.

    Automatic Power Switching: In case of a power supply failure, the system seamlessly switches to the Li-ION batteries, ensuring uninterrupted security monitoring.

    Battery Charging Functionality: The code includes a section that enables automatic charging of the Li-ION batteries, ensuring they are always ready for use when needed.

    Cellular Notification: Integrated with a SIM module, the alarm system has the capability to make phone calls to predefined numbers when triggered, alerting the user of a potential intrusion.

    Compliance with Regulations: Addressing the regulatory requirements of some countries, the code includes a function that handles cellular network registration issues. Even without network registration, the system remains operational by resolving network connectivity problems, ensuring long-term functionality and compliance.

This open-source project provides a comprehensive solution for home or office security, integrating advanced features and ensuring continuous operation under various circumstances. Feel free to explore the code, modify it according to your specific needs, and contribute to the development of this reliable Burglar Alarm system.
